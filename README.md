Please note that this project is currently in the planning phase and development has not yet begun. The information provided in this README is a high-level overview of our vision and goals for HUDDLE.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a user-friendly and inclusive social networking app that caters specifically to Nigerian students. By leveraging technology, we aim to empower students to connect, collaborate, and share valuable information about their universities, academics, and social events.

## Features (Planned)

- **Information Sharing**: Easily share and access important information about universities, including admissions requirements, course details, academic calendars, and more.

- **Discussion Forums**: Engage in meaningful discussions with fellow students on various topics related to university life, academics, career guidance, and social events.

- **Events and Parties**: Stay up to date with the latest social events, parties, and campus activities happening in Nigerian universities.

- **Connect with Peers**: Build connections with students from different universities, collaborate on projects, form study groups, and network for future career opportunities.
